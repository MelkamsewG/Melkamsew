    <h1>Melkamu K.</h1>
    <p> My name is Melkamu K. I was born in Ethiopia from my parents who were poor farmers.</b>
        The society in which I was born is primitive and povery was prevalent there.There was </b>
        no school,infrustructure, and health inistitutes. I grown up with my grand parents and </b>
        after highschool completion, I joined university and graduated with civil engineering and </b>
        after few years working in the municipality of my home city, I got the Diversity Visa lottery</b>
        from USA government.I have two kids back home and been struggling with life to support my children.</b>
    </p>
    <p> Before I joined Maharishi International University, I passed through many ups and downs of life in </b>
        in USA. Struglling with stress, I'm still trying to continue leaning while supporting my family. </b>
        Eventhogh I have strong passion for learning, it hasn't become real in my life with the </b>
        pace I wanted. I used to work with AutoCAD, SAP2000, and ETABS softwares for structural design </b>
        and analysis. After completion of this course, I'm planning to create an ultimate design and analysis software of civil engineering</b>
        works. </b>
