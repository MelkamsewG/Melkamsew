    <h1>Melkamu K.</h1>
    <p> My name is Melkamu K. I was born in Ethiopia from my parents who were poor farmers.</b>
        The society in which I was born is primitive and povery was prevalent there.There was </b>
        no school and any infrustructure health inistitutes. I grown up with my grand parents and </b>
        completion, I'm graduated with civil engineering and after few years working in the </b>
        municipality of my home city, I got the Diversity Visa lottery from USA government.</b>
        I have two kids back home and been struggling with life to support my children. </p>
    <p> Before I joined Marishi International University I come through many ups downs of life </b>
        in USA. Eventhogh I have strong passion for learning, it hasn't come to my life with the </b>
        pace wanted. I used AutoCAD, SAP2000, and ETABS softwares for structural design and analysis.</b>
        I'm planning to create an ultimate design and analysis software of civil engineering works. </b>
